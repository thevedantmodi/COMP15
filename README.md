# COMP15

This is a collection of my notes when taking COMP15: Data Structures and Algorithms in Spring 2023 at Tufts University.

The root directory of this repository contains notes from each date that the course met for lecture, named by the date in M-DD format. The notes are in Markdown format, so can be viewed best in either on this GitHub repository online, or via a text editor on a desktop.
